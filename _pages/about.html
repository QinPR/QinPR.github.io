<p>Iâ€™m a <a href="https://cs.uchicago.edu/mpcs-pre-doctoral-program/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pre-Doctoral M.S.</a> student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the University of Chicago</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~haryadi/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Haryadi S. Gunawi</a>.  Previously, I was honored to work as a research intern at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Research Asia</a> under the fantastic mentorship of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lequ/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lei Qu</a>, and be advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~ychung/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Yeh-Ching Chung</a> as a student research assistant at <a href="https://damo.alibaba.com/?language=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Alibaba Group</a> and <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen</a>.</p>

<p>My research focuses on <strong>Operating Systems, Storage Systems, Distributed Systems and their intersections with ML</strong>. I enjoy building more performant systems in the context of:</p>
<ol>
  <li>High Efficiency (e.g. prefetch and cache eviction co-design for higher cache efficiency)</li>
  <li>Low Latency (e.g. mitigating tail latencies in cloud storage systems)</li>
  <li>Workload Awared (e.g. workload characterization and prediction for distributed machine learning clusters)</li>
</ol>

<p><u>I'm activately looking for <strong>2025 Fall Ph.D. Opportunities</strong>!</u></p>
