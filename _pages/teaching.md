#### Astronomy  
I enjoy watching the starry night when I am free. The belowing picture is when I and my freinds participate the China National Astronomy Olympiad (CNAO) in Hangzhou, China in 2018.

Badminton is a hobby of mine since childhood. I enjoy playing badminton with my friends (Even I would play it in the evening at the date I wrote this page).
