I am **Peiran Qin** (in Chinese 秦培然), an incoming Pre-Doctoral Computer Science student at the University of Chicago, advised by Prof. [Haryadi S. Gunawi](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~haryadi/). I am interested in Systems as well as their intersection with Machine Learning.  

Previously, I was honored to work as a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) under the fantastic mentorship of [Lei Qu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lequ/), and be advised by Prof. [Yeh-Ching Chung](http://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~ychung/) at CUHK(SZ).
