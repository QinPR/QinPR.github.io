I am a [Pre-Doctoral M.S.](https://cs.uchicago.edu/mpcs-pre-doctoral-program/) student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, advised by Prof. [Haryadi S. Gunawi](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~haryadi/).  Previously, I was honored to work as a research intern at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) under the fantastic mentorship of [Lei Qu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lequ/), and be advised by Prof. [Yeh-Ching Chung](http://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~ychung/) at as a student research assistant at [Alibaba Group](https://damo.alibaba.com/?language=en) and [the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). 

As a systems researcher, I am interested in **Operating Systems, Storage Sytems, Distributed Sytems and their intersections with Machine Learning**. Specifically speaking, I focus on building more performant systems in the context of:  
  1) High Efficiency (e.g. prefetch and cache eviction co-design for higher cache efficiency)  
  2) Low Latency (e.g. mitigating tail latencies in cloud storage systems) 
  3) Workload Awared (e.g. workload characterization and prediction for distributed machine learning clusters)  
For the my detailed relevant work, please refer to my [CV](https://qinpr.github.io/assets/cv/peiran_cv.pdf).
